Greatly improves the capabilities of the Nation Designer by adding missing religions, cultures and sprites

All modifiers available ingame are represented via the pickable ideas, with both positive and negative versions. 

Positive ideas now scale up to ten levels, with an high point cost when taking such strong ideas. On the other hand, negative ideas give your nation disadvantages, but grant you additional points to spend in the Nation Designer.
